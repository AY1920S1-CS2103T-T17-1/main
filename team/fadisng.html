<p>My team consists of a group of 5 NUS computer science students working on this project as part of a software engineering project.
The task was to enhance a basic Command Line Interface(CLI) addressbook app into an app that suits the needs of a target group of people.
We decided to morph it into a project management app for students as it is more relatable and we could
make changes based on our own personal needs as students which are representative of the target group. Our app,
<em>MyProject</em> is for students, by students.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="overview"><a class="link" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MyProject</em> is a one stop project management app for team leaders to store and manage your multiple projects
through the use of a CLI. <em>MyProject</em> provides a centralized platform to store, edit and
display all your important information in a simple and intuitive manner. <em>MyProject</em> has unique functions
such as sending emails to members within the app as well as financial tracking capabilities. Currently our main
target group is for university students, but we intend to develop further to accommodate working adults as well in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what <em>MyProject</em> looks like after you <code>checkout</code> to a chosen project:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 1. The graphical user interface for <em>MyProject</em>.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My role in creating the basic project model was to implement the task feature. Every project has different
tasks with different deadlines and my goal was to make storing, accessing and displaying these tasks in the
most user-friendly way possible, while keeping the user interactions as simple as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, my enhancement to the project as a whole was implementing the sorting mechanisms for the different
types of information that can be displayed such as the list of tasks and spending. This was to allow for users to
choose how they want to organize their information while ensuring that the commands to sort all these information
follow the same format so that it is easy for users to remember these commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sections illustrates these enhancements in more detail as well as the relevant documentation
I have added to the user and developer guides.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Added <strong>the ability to sort the different types of information according to user preferences</strong>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Allows the user to choose which kind of sorting order they&#8217;d like out of a pre-specified list of sorting orders(this list is shown in the highlighted section below) for the different types of information displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the main goal of <em>MyProject</em> was to provide a platform to store and display all these important information in an organized and systematic manner.
Giving the user such options to sort all these information helps them locate what they need easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The type of sorting order is maintained until the app is closed. What this means is that whenever you add or edit items into the displayed list, that item will automatically be inserted into the correctly sorted position.
This reduces the need for users to continuously enter the sort command whenever they add or edit the list of items.<br>
Another noteworthy highlight is that all sort commands follow the same format. For example <code>sortTask 1</code> and <code>sortSpending 1</code> will sort both lists by alphabetical order.
Therefore users only need to remember the command for 1 sort command and the rest follows suit!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges: The main challenge of this feature was that I needed to know how the other features were implemented before I can write the code to sort them. For example, I needed to wait
for the completion of the meeting feature before I could implement the sorting feature for the list of meetings displayed. This also required
me to understand the internal workings of other features like how these items are stored and displayed so that I could implement the appropriate methods to sort them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Added the tasks feature for the project model including basic commands such as adding, deleting and editing tasks.</p>

<p>This command sorts the tasks in the task list of the current working project.<br>
Format: <code>sortTask INDEX</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>INDEX</code> refers to the index of the list provided in the highlighted section above which corresponds to the type of sorting you wish to apply.
For example, index 1 corresponds to sorting by alphabetical order. For the case of sorting tasks, only numbers between 1 and 4 are applicable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have added many different tasks with different deadlines and progresses into <em>MyProject</em>.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default sorting order that <em>MyProject</em> offers is by increasing order of time(index 2). However you wish to group those tasks that are done in one group and those not done in another group and
then further sort each group by increasing order of time(index 4) to track the progress of your tasks.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply type in the command <code>sortTask 4</code> and all the tasks in the list will immediately be sorted accordingly.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, whenever you add a new task(Section 3.2.4) or edit the details of an existing task(Section 3.3.2), <em>MyProject</em> will automatically insert
the newly added or edited task into the correct position based on this new sorting order so you don&#8217;t have to continuously type this command whenever
you wish to add or edit tasks!<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a step by step process on how to do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Firstly, since this command is labeled with [Checkout] at the start, ensure that you <code>checkout</code> to a project first.
Notice how the tasks in the task list are currently at the default sorting order which is by increasing order of time.<br>
<span class="image"><img src="../images/sortTask1.png" alt="sortTask1"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, enter the command <code>sortTask 4</code> into the command line and press enter. You can choose any index from 1-4 depending
on which type of sorting order you wish to sort by based on the specifications provided in the highlighted section above.<br>
<span class="image"><img src="../images/sortTask2.png" alt="sortTask2"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following success message will be displayed if the input was entered correctly. Check that the type of sorting
displayed in the success message is the one you actually wanted.<br>
The tasks in the task list will then be immediately sorted accordingly as shown in the white box.<br>
<span class="image"><img src="../images/sortTask3.png" alt="sortTask3"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now let&#8217;s say the deadline for task 2(Do UG) is pushed forward by a week and you&#8217;ve just completed it. Type in the command
<code>editTask 2 d/ c/04/12/2019 0000</code>(check out section 3.3.2 for more details on the editTask command) into the command line and press enter.<br>
The task will be edited accordingly and immediately be sorted into the correct position as shown below.<br>

<p>The diagram below shows sortTask works. There are 2 possible error messages that can occur. Firstly,
if the user inputs an index that is not applicable to the type of items sorted. For example, <code>sortTask 5</code>
is invalid as index 5 is linked to a price sorting mechanism which is not applicable to sorting tasks. Secondly,
an error will be shown if the user attempts to sort the items in the same order is the current sorting order.
For example, since the default sorting order for tasks is by increasing order of date, the command <code>sortTask 2</code>
will be invalid if the sorting order has never been changed before. Otherwise if the input is valid,
the sorting will occur and the newly sorted task list will be displayed.</p>

<li>
<p>Looking back, my team and I could&#8217;ve had better planning from the start as we began to run into certain

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A major challenge I faced was learning how to use GitHub and several other tools which were used for this project. Having no background in coding and only being exposed to coding in NUS modules such as CS2030 and CS2040, all these external tools to help with large scale programming were foreign to me and it took me a long time to get accustomed to it. However I am definitely thankful for this opportunity to be exposed to these tools which will help me in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall this was a positive experience for me despite the slightly heavy workload as many things that I&#8217;ve learnt from this project would be essential in the future for me as a programmer and it has created a foundation for me to work on.</p>
