<div class="paragraph">
<p>My team developed a one-stop app to store and manage projects and their
relevant information for project team leaders. Team leaders refers to
those who are in charge of planning an event such as concert, sports
event and software engineering project. We realise that many students in NUS
are involved in such events but all of them face some common problems.
These problems range from arranging a meeting, keeping track of the finance information
and delegating tasks. Thus, we have MyProject as the solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>MyProject</strong> has a few distinctive features to help them out which includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An address book to record contact details of the planning committee members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating common free slot among members for meeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping track of budgets information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updating the members with regards to the project via email</p>

<p>Monitoring members' performance in terms of attendance and amount of tasks done</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: It allows user to monitor the budget situation
for a project. For example the umbrella organization of a cca
set the budgets for an event which includes equipment with an
amount of 1000 dollars. The user can add this Budget to the
project. When an expense is made under this budget, let’s say
200 dollars are used to rent fog machines for the event which
can be claimed under equipment budget. The user can add this expense under the equipment Budget.
MyProject will minus away this amount from the budget and calculate the remaining amount. At any time, the user can view a detailed summary of the budgets in a pie-chart format
indicating all the expenses under a budget and an overview of how much are left for each budget in the project overview.
A even more convenient function is that it generates an excel sheet that corresponds to the budgets data. It can be used for sending out to the rest of the planning committee members to update them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationale: In many projects, finance information is only restricted to the treasurer but it is actually important for members in the planning committee to know about it.
For example, the publicity in charge may reconsider the props he’s going to use after viewing the budget situation.
Thus, monitoring the budgets information is essential for the team leader to know the situation
and to update the members if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: As a beginner of JavaFX, understanding the concept of how UI works was challenging especially given a rather advanced set up.
The implementation of the budget is actually a finance object containing a list of budgets
objects which each contains a list of spending objects. This implementation requires
a lot of interaction with jackson which is also a challenge.
Lastly, playing with Apache POI was really fun. I get to create and
style excel sheets and learn about using other&#8217;s API along the way.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Allows the user to switch to a project to work on it.
As the user types a command, the display of the application will change to a state that
best fits what the user would want to see after typing that command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rational: Users would expect to see different information given different commands.
If he adds an expense, he may want to see information with regards to finance
thus displaying the list of budgets maybe more suitable than displaying the
project overview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The logic and maintaining design pattern is the
hard part for this as different commands needs different interfaces
and the switching between interface that involves switching to and from
the current working project.</p>

<h3 id="Implementation-Change-in-UI-display"><a class="link" href="#Implementation-Change-in-UI-display">Change in UI display</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step of changing UI display is to find out
whether a change in UI is needed given a command from user.
This is done in the CommandResult class constructor. If a command
word matches actions that is email related or help or exit,
the flag will indicate that a change in UI is not needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, a class to represent the state of UI is needed to remember
a history which is the <code>UiEvent</code> class.UiEvent is a class that represent
a type of UiDisplay as an event. It stores the current state of the
application&#8217;s UI and the current working project index if it exists.
Whenever a command is executed, a new UiEvent will be generated and stored in history
if this command lead to a state
that is different from the current one.
The <code>viewHistory</code> is stored in the <code>MainWindow</code> class as a stack of UiEvents
and the class also maintains a currentStatePointer. When a <code>back</code> command
is executed, it can check back on what is the previous state.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>MainWindow#changeUiDisplay</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Change the Ui and change the current state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MainWindow#getPreviousState</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Pops the stack and peek to look for the previous state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MainWindow#handleBack</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Change the Ui display to the previous state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MainWindow#getState</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Get the state given a command word.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example of how the UI behave at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application and the <code>viewHistory</code> will be initialized with the
<code>PROJECT_LIST</code> state. The <code>currentStatePointer</code> is currently pointing to
that single address book state.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/ChangeUiDisplayState0.png" alt="state" width="320" height="240">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user executes <code>checkout 1</code> command to checkout to project 1 to work on.
During the execution of the <code>checkout</code> command, when commandresult is created,
it detects that there is a need to change the Ui and the flag is made to true.
In the <code>MainWindow</code>, since a change is needed, <code>MainWindow#changeUiDisplay</code> is called
to change the display to <code>PROJECT_OVERVIEW</code> which is found out using
the <code>MainWindow#getState</code> method. It also set the <code>currentState</code> to be <code>PROJECT_OVERVIEW</code>.
The UiEvent with the state of <code>PROJECT_LIST</code> and an empty index will be stored
in the <code>viewHistory</code> stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/ChangeUiDisplayState1.png" alt="state" width="480" height="360">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The user now decide to add a budget by <code>addBudget b/ equipment 3000.00</code>.
This command does need a change in Ui display but the state of this command
is exactly the same as the previous command thus <code>MainWindow#changeUiDisplay</code>
will be called with the same state.
Thus, the method <code>MainWindow#changeUiDisplay</code> is still called but this time
it is called to update the information in the current display and set the
current state to be still the current state. Thus, the <code>currentStatePointer</code> does
not move.</p>

</td>
<td class="content">
If a command fails its execution, a <code>commandResult</code> wont be generated thus no change in Ui will happen.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The user now wants to have a better view of the budgets and executes
<code>listBudget</code>. Same step follows through the checkout command.</p>

<div class="content">
<img src="../images/ChangeUiDisplayState3.png" alt="state" width="480" height="360">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. The user now decides to go back to the home page and executes
two consecutive <code>back</code> command. At the execute stage in <code>MainWindow</code>,
it detects it is a back command and <code>MainWindow#handleBack</code> is called.
This method will then pop the current state by <code>MainWindow#getPreviousState</code>
and call <code>MainWindow#changeUiDisplay</code> to display the previous Ui.</p>
